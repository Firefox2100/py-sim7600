Quickstart
==========

This section will guide you through the process of utilizing the library, communicating with the device, and build a minimal application.

Installation
============

This library is not yet uploaded to PyPi, so you will need to install it from git.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/Firefox2100/py-sim7600

It would also install the required dependencies.

.. note::

    In the future, when the library is more stable, it will be uploaded to PyPi. This document will then be updated to reflect that.
